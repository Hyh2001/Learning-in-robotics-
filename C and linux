c is platform independent ( what is platform?  
                                architecture, operating system.
                                 It's portable means that the program can be used through different compiler on different platform without
                                changing the text or just change a little.) 
                                

execution through interpretation:
             it executed each rolls without making them into one executable file.
             
Thinking:    The advantage and disadvantage between executing program through interpreter and compiler?(
                       advantage of interpretation: 
                            It is more protable, but less efficient
                        )


To compile a c file in linux:
            gcc main.c(name of the text file)
                -o main.o(name of the executable file) main.c(name of the text file) /to compile the file into given name executable file 
                -Wall (show all the warning and false)
